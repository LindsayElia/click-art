# click-art

This is a simple interactive art game where users can select from a randomly generated color palette to create pixelated art.

The entire project was created with plain JavaScript for practicing DOM manipulation. No direct HTML or CSS was used.

Demo is at [http://lindsayelia.github.io/click-art/](http://lindsayelia.github.io/click-art/).

Future TODO: Add a feature where players can share a screenshot of their creations via email or social media.
